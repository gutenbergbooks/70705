  <h3 class='c012'>THE LEAGUE OF YOUTH.<br /> <br /> INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After the momentous four years of his first visit to
Italy, to which we owe <cite>Brand</cite> and <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>, Ibsen
left Rome in May 1868, visited Florence, and then
spent the summer at Berchtesgaden in Southern
Bavaria. There he was busy “mentally wrestling”
with the new play which was to take shape as <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>De
Unges Forbund</cite></span> (<cite>The League of Youth</cite>); but he did
not begin to put it on paper until, after a short stay
at Munich, he settled down in Dresden, in the early
autumn. Thence he wrote to his publisher, Hegel,
on October 31: “My new work is making rapid
progress.... The whole outline is finished and
written down. The first act is completed, the second
will be in the course of a week, and by the end of the
year I hope to have the play ready. It will be in
prose, and in every way adapted for the stage. The
title is <cite>The League of Youth; or, The Almighty &amp; Co.</cite>, a
comedy, in five acts.” At Hegel’s suggestion he
omitted the second title, “though,” he wrote, “it
could have given offence to no one <em>who had read the
play</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Apparently the polishing of the dialogue took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>longer than Ibsen anticipated. It was his first play
in modern prose, and the medium did not come easy
to him. Six or seven years earlier, he wrote the
opening scenes of <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite> in prose, but was
dissatisfied with the effect, and recast the dialogue in
rhymed verse. Having now outgrown his youthful
romanticism, and laid down, in <cite>Brand</cite> and <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>,
the fundamental positions of his criticism of life, he
felt that to carry that criticism into detail he must
come to close quarters with reality; and to that end
he required a suppler instrument than verse. He
must cultivate, as he afterwards<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> put it, “the very
much more difficult art of writing the genuine, plain
language spoken in real life.” Probably the mastery
of this new art cost him more effort than he anticipated,
for, instead of having the play finished by the
end of 1868, he did not despatch the manuscript to
Copenhagen until March 1869. It was published on
September 30 of that year.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the comedy was still in process of conception,
Ibsen had written to his publisher: “This new,
<em>peaceable</em> work is giving me great pleasure.” It thus
appears that he considered it less polemical in its
character than the poems which had immediately
preceded it. If his intentions were pacific, they were
entirely frustrated. The play was regarded as a
violent and wanton attack on the Norwegian Liberal
party, while Stensgård was taken for a personal
lampoon on Björnson. Its first performance at
the Christiania Theatre (October 18, 1869) passed
quietly enough; but at the second and third performances
an organised opposition took the field, and
disturbances amounting almost to a riot occurred.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Public feeling soon calmed down, and the play (the
first prose comedy of any importance in Norwegian
literature) became one of the most popular pieces in
the repertory of the theatre. But it led to an
estrangement from Björnson and the Liberal party,
which was not healed for many a day—not, indeed,
until <cite>Ghosts</cite> had shown the Norwegian public the
folly of attempting to make party capital out of the
works of a poet who stood far above party.</p>

<p class='c001'>The estrangement from Björnson had begun some
time before the play appeared. A certain misunderstanding
had followed the appearance of <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
and had been deepened by political differences.
Björnson had become an ardent National Liberal, with
leanings towards Republicanism; Ibsen was not at all
a Republican (he deeply offended Björnson by accepting
orders and decorations), and his political sympathies,
while not of a partisan nature, were mainly
“Scandinavian”—that is to say, directed towards a
closer union of the three Scandinavian kingdoms. Distance,
and the evil offices of gossiping friends, played
their part in begetting dissension. Ibsen’s last friendly
letter to Björnson (of these years) was written in the
last days of 1867; in the first days of 1869, while he
was actually busied with <cite>The League of Youth</cite>, we find
him declining to contribute to a Danish magazine for
the reason (among others) that Björnson was to be one
of its joint editors.</p>

<p class='c001'>The news of the stormy reception of his comedy
reached Ibsen in Egypt, where, as the guest of the
Khedive, he was attending the opening of the Suez
Canal. He has recorded the incident in a poem, <cite>At
Port Said</cite>. On his return to Dresden he wrote to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>Hegel (December 14, 1869): “The reception of <cite>The
League of Youth</cite> pleases me very much; for the disapprobation
I was prepared, and it would have been a
disappointment to me if there had been none. But
what I was not prepared for was that Björnson should
feel himself attacked by the play, as rumour says he
does. Is this really the case? He must surely see
that it is not himself I have had in mind, but his
pernicious and ‘lie-steeped’ clique who have served
me as models. However, I will write to him to-day
or to-morrow, and I hope that the affair, in spite of
all differences, will end in a reconciliation.” The
intended letter does not appear to have been written;
nor would it, probably, have produced the desired
effect, for Björnson’s resentment was very deep. He
had already (in November) written a poem to Johan
Sverdrup, the leader of the Liberal party, in which
he deplored the fact that “the sacred grove of poetry
no longer afforded sanctuary against assassination,” or
as the Norwegian word vigorously expresses it,
“sneak-murder.” Long afterwards, in 1881, he explained
what he meant by this term: “It was not the
portrayal of contemporary life and known personages
that I called assassination. It was the fact that <cite>The
League of Youth</cite> sought to represent our young
Liberal party as a gang of ambitious speculators,
whose patriotism was as empty as their phraseology;
and particularly that prominent men were first made
clearly recognisable, and then had false hearts and
shady characters foisted upon them.” It is difficult
to see, indeed, how Ibsen can have expected Björnson
to distinguish very clearly between an attack on his
“lie-steeped clique” and a lampoon on himself.
Even Stensgård’s religious phraseology, the confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>with which he claims God as a member of his party,
was at that time characteristic of Björnson. The
case, in fact, seems to have been very like that of the
portraiture of Leigh Hunt in Harold Skimpole.
Both Dickens and Ibsen had unconsciously taken
more from their respective models than they intended.
They imagined, perhaps, that the features which did
not belong to the original would conceal the likeness;
whereas their actual effect was only to render the
portraits libellous.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eleven years passed before Björnson and Ibsen
were reconciled. In 1880 (after the appearance of <cite>A
Doll’s House</cite> and before that of <cite>Ghosts</cite>), Björnson
wrote in an American magazine: “I think I have a
pretty thorough acquaintance with the dramatic literature
of the world, and I have not the slightest hesitation
in saying that Henrik Ibsen possesses more
dramatic power than any other playwriter of our
day. The fact that I am not always partial to the
style of his work makes me all the more certain that
I am right in my judgment of him.”</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The League of Youth</cite> soon became very popular in
Norway, and it had considerable success in Sweden
and Denmark. It was acted with notable excellence
at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. Outside of
Scandinavia it has never taken any hold of the stage.
At the date of its appearance, Ibsen was still quite
unknown, even in Germany; and when he became
known, its technique was already antiquated. It has
been acted once or twice both in Germany and England,
and has proved very amusing on the stage; but it is
essentially an experimental, transitional work. The
poet is trying his tools.</p>

<p class='c001'>The technical influence of Scribe and his school is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>apparent in every scene. Ibsen’s determination not
to rest content with the conventions of that school
may already be discerned, indeed, in his disuse of the
soliloquy and the aside; but, apart from these flagrant
absurdities, he permits himself to employ almost all
the devices of the Scribe method. Note, for example,
how much of the action arises from sheer misunderstanding.
The whole second act turns upon the Chamberlain’s
misunderstanding of the bent of Stensgård’s
diatribe in the first act. As the Chamberlain is deliberately
misled by his daughter and Fieldbo, the
misunderstanding is not, perhaps, technically inadmissible.
Yet it has to be maintained by very artificial
means. Why, one may ask, does not Fieldbo, in his
long conversation with Stensgård, in the second <a id='corrxii.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='act.'>act,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xii.15'><ins class='correction' title='act.'>act,</ins></a></span>
warn him of the thin ice on which he is skating?
There is no sufficient reason, except that the great
situation at the end of the act would thus be rendered
impossible. It is in the fourth act, however, that the
methods of the vaudevillist are most apparent. It is
one string of blunders of the particular type which
the French significantly call “quiproquos.” Some
arise through the quite diabolical genius for malicious
wire-pulling developed by old Lundestad;
but most of them are based upon that deliberate and
elaborate vagueness of expression on the part of the
characters which is the favourite artifice of the professor
of theatrical sleight-of-hand. We are not even
spared the classic quiproquo of the proposal by proxy
mistaken for a proposal direct—Stensgård’s overtures
to Madam Rundholmen on behalf of Bastian being
accepted by her as an offer on his own behalf. We
are irresistibly reminded of Mrs. Bardell’s fatal
misunderstanding of Mr. Pickwick’s intentions. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>this, to be sure, is excellent farce, but there is no
originality in the expedients by which it is carried on.
Equally conventional, and equally redolent of Scribe,
is the conduct of the fifth act. The last drop of
effect is wrung out of the quiproquos with an almost
mathematical accuracy. We are reminded of a game
at puss-in-the-four-corners, in which Stensgård tries
every corner in turn, only to find himself at last left
out in the cold. Then, as the time approaches to ring
down the curtain, every one is seized with a fever of
amiability, the Chamberlain abandons all his principles
and prejudices, even to the point of subscribing for
twenty copies of Aslaksen’s newspaper, and the whole
thing becomes scarcely less unreal than one of the
old-comedy endings, in which the characters stand in
a semicircle while each delivers a couplet of the
epilogue. It is difficult to believe that the facile
optimism of this conclusion could at any time have
satisfied the mind which, only twelve years later, conceived
the picture of Oswald Alving shrinking together
in his chair and babbling, “Mother—give me the sun.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But, while we realise with what extraordinary
rapidity and completeness Ibsen outgrew this phase
of his art, we must not overlook the genuine merits of
this brilliant comedy. With all its faults, it was an
advance on the technique of its day, and was hailed
as such by a critic so penetrating as George Brandes.
Placing ourselves at the point of view of the time,
we may perhaps say that its chief defect is its marked
inequality of style. The first act is purely preparatory;
the fifth act, as we have noted, is a rather
perfunctory winding-up. The real play lies in the
intervening acts; and each of these belongs to a
different order of art. The second act is a piece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>high comedy, quite admirable in its kind; the third
act, both in tone and substance, verges upon melodrama;
while the fourth act is nothing but rattling
farce. Even from the Scribe point of view, this
jumping from key to key is a fault. Another objection
which Scribe would probably have urged is
that several of Fieldbo’s speeches, and the attitude of
the Chamberlain towards him, are, on the face of
them, incomprehensible, and are only retrospectively
explained. The poetics of that school forbid all
reliance on retrospect; perhaps because they do not
contemplate the production of any play about which
any human being would care to think twice.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third act, though superficially a rather tame
interlude between the vigorous second act and the
bustling fourth, is in reality the most characteristic
of the five. The second act might be signed Augier,
and the fourth Labiche; but in the third the coming
Ibsen is manifest. The scene between the Chamberlain
and Monsen is, in its disentangling of the past, a
preliminary study for much of his later work—a premonition,
in fact, of his characteristic method. Here,
too, in the character of Selma and her outburst
of revolt, we have by far the most original feature of
the play. In Selma there is no trace of French
influence, spiritual or technical. With admirable
perspicacity, Dr. Brandes realised from the outset the
significance of this figure. “Selma,” he wrote, “is a
new creation, and her relation to the family might
form the subject of a whole drama. But in the play
as it stands she has scarcely room to move.” The
drama which Brandes here foresaw, Ibsen wrote ten
year’s later in <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>With reference to the phrase <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“De lokale forhold,”</span>
here lamely represented by “the local situation,”
Ibsen has a curious remark in a letter to Markus
Grönvold, dated Stockholm, September 3, 1877. His
German translator, he says, has rendered the phrase
literally <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“lokale Verhältnisse”</span>—“which is wrong,
because no suggestion of comicality or narrow-mindedness
is conveyed by this German expression.
The rendering ought to be <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘unsere berechtigten
Eigenthümlichkeiten,’</span> an expression which conveys
the same meaning to Germans as the Norwegian one
does to us Scandinavians.” This suggestion is, unfortunately,
of no help to the English translator,
especially when it is remembered in what context
Aslaksen uses the phrase <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“de lokale forhold”</span> in the
fifth act of <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>.</p>

  <h3 class='c015'>PILLARS OF SOCIETY. <br /> <br /> INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the eight years that intervened between <cite>The
League of Youth</cite> and <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>—his second
prose play of modern life—Ibsen published a small
<a id='corrxvi.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ollection'>collection</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xvi.6'><ins class='correction' title='ollection'>collection</ins></a></span> of his poems (1871), and his “World-Historic
Drama,” <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite> (1873).
After he had thus dismissed from his mind the figure
of Julian the Apostate, which had haunted it ever
since his earliest days in Rome, he deliberately
abandoned, once for all, what may be called masquerade
romanticism—that external stimulus to the
imagination which lies in remoteness of time and
unfamiliarity of scene and costume. It may be that,
for the moment, he also intended to abandon, not
merely romanticism, but romance—to deal solely with
the literal and commonplace facts of life, studied in
the dry light of everyday experience. If that was
his purpose, it was very soon to break down; but in
<cite>Pillars of Society</cite> he more nearly achieved it than in
any other work.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many causes contributed to the <a id='corrxvi.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='usually'>unusually</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xvi.22'><ins class='correction' title='usually'>unusually</ins></a></span> long pause
between <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite> and <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>.
The summer of 1874 was occupied with a visit to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Norway—the first he had paid since the Hegira of
ten years earlier. A good deal of time was devoted
to the revision of some of his earlier works, which
were republished in Copenhagen; while the increasing
vogue of his plays on the stage involved a considerable
amount of business correspondence. <cite>The Vikings</cite> and
<cite>The Pretenders</cite> were acted in these years, not only
throughout Scandinavia, but at many of the leading
theatres of Germany; and in 1876, after much discussion
and negotiation, <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> was for the first
time placed on the stage, in Christiania.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first mention of <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> occurs in a
letter from Ibsen to his publisher, Hegel, of October
23, 1875, in which he mentions that the first act,
“always to me the most difficult part of a play,” is
ready, and states that it will be “a drama in five acts.”
Unless this be a mere slip of the pen, it is curious as
showing that, even when the first act was finished,
Ibsen did not foresee in detail the remainder of the
action. In the course of further development an act
dropped out of his scheme. On November 25, 1875,
he reports to Hegel: “The first act of my new drama
is ready—the fair copy written; I am now working
at Act Second”; but it was not until the summer of
1877 that the completed manuscript was sent to
Copenhagen. The book was published in the early
autumn.</p>

<p class='c001'>The theatrical success of <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> was
immediate and striking. First performed in Copenhagen,
November 18, 1877, it soon found its way to
all the leading stages of Scandinavia. In Berlin, in
the early spring of 1878, it was produced at five
different theatres within a single fortnight; and it
has ever since maintained its hold on the German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>stage. Before the end of the century, it had been
acted more than 1200 times in Germany and Austria.
An adaptation of the play, by the present writer, was
produced at the old Gaiety Theatre, London, for a
single performance, on the afternoon of December 15,
1880—this being the first time that Ibsen’s name had
appeared on an English playbill. Again, in 1889, a
single performance of it was given at the Opera
Comique Theatre; and yet again in May 1901 the Stage
Society gave two performances of it at the Strand
Theatre. In the United States it has been acted
frequently in German, but very rarely in English.
The first performance took place in New York in
1891. The play did not reach the French stage until
1896, when it was performed by M. Lugné-Poë's
organisation, L'Œuvre. In other countries one hears
of a single performance of it, here and there; but,
except in Scandinavia and Germany, it has nowhere
taken a permanent hold upon the theatre.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is the reason far to seek. By the time the
English, American, and French public had fully
awakened to the existence of Ibsen, he himself had
so far outgrown the phase of his development marked
by <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>, that the play already seemed
commonplace and old-fashioned. It exactly suited
the German public of the 'eighties; it was exactly
on a level with their theatrical intelligence. But it
was above the theatrical intelligence of the Anglo-American
public, and—I had almost said—below that
of the French public. This is, of course, an exaggeration.
What I mean is that there was no possible
reason why the countrymen of Augier and Dumas
should take any special interest in <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>.
It was not obviously in advance of these masters in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>technical skill, and the vein of Teutonic sentiment
running through it could not greatly appeal to the
Parisian public of that period. Thus it is not in the
least surprising that, outside of Germany and Scandinavia,
<cite>Pillars of Society</cite> had everywhere to follow
in the wake of <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> and <cite>Ghosts</cite>, and
was everywhere found something of an anti-climax.
Possibly its time may be yet to come in England and
America. A thoroughly well-mounted and well-acted
revival might now appeal to that large class of play-goers
which stands on very much the same intellectual
level on which the German public stood in the
eighteen-eighties.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is of all Ibsen’s works the least characteristic,
because, acting on a transitory phase of theory;
he has been almost successful in divesting it of poetic
charm. There is not even a Selma in it. Of his
later plays, only <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> is equally
prosaic in substance; and it is raised far above the
level of the commonplace by the genial humour, the
magnificent creative energy, displayed in the character
of Stockmann. In <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> there is nothing
that rises above the commonplace. Compared with
Stockmann, Bernick seems almost a lay-figure, and
even Lona Hessel is an intellectual construction—formed
of a blend of new theory with old sentiment—rather
than an absolute creation, a living and breathing
woman, like Nora, or Mrs. Alving, or Rebecca, or
Hedda. This is, in brief, the only play of Ibsen’s in
which plot can be said to preponderate over character.
The plot is extraordinarily ingenious and deftly
pieced together. Several of the scenes are extremely
effective from the theatrical point of view, and in a
good many individual touches we may recognise the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>incomparable master-hand. One of these touches
is the scene between Bernick and Rörlund in the
third act, in which Bernick’s craving for casuistical
consolation meets with so painful a rebuff. Only a
great dramatist could have devised this scene; but to
compare it with a somewhat similar passage in <cite>The
Pretenders</cite>—the scene in the fourth act between King
Skule and Jatgeir Skald—is to realise what is meant
by the difference between dramatic poetry and
dramatic prose.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have called Lona Hessel a composite character,
because she embodies in a concentrated form the two
different strains of feeling that run through the whole
play. Beyond the general attack on social pharisaism
announced in the very title, we have a clear assertion
of the claim of women to moral and economical individuality
and independence. Dina, with her insistence
on “becoming something for herself” before
she will marry Johan, unmistakably foreshadows
Nora and Petra. But at the same time the poet is
far from having cleared his mind of the old ideal of
the infinitely self-sacrificing, dumbly devoted woman,
whose life has no meaning save in relation to some
more or less unworthy male—the Ingeborg-Agnes-Solveig
ideal we may call it. In the original edition
of <cite>The Pretenders</cite>, Ingeborg said to Skule: “To love,
to sacrifice all, and be forgotten, that is woman’s
saga;” and out of that conception arose the very
tenderly touched figure of Martha in this play. If
Martha, then, stands for the old ideal—the ideal of
the older generation—and Dina for the ideal of the
younger generation, Lona Hessel hovers between the
two. At first sight she seems like an embodiment
of the “strong-minded female,” the champion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>Woman’s Rights, and despiser of all feminine graces
and foibles. But in the end it appears that her devotion
to Bernick has been no less deep and enduring
than Martha’s devotion to Johan. Her “old friendship
does not rust” is a delightful speech; but it
points back to the Ibsen of the past, not forward to
the Ibsen of the future. Yet this is not wholly true:
for the strain of sentiment which inspired it never
became extinct in the poet. He believed to the end
in the possibility and the beauty of great self-forgetful
human emotions; and there his philosophy
went very much deeper than that of some of his
disciples.</p>

<p class='c001'>In consistency of style, and in architectural symmetry
of construction, the play marks a great advance
upon <cite>The League of Youth</cite>. From the end of the first
act to the middle of the last, it is a model of skilful
plot-development. The exposition, which occupies
so much of the first act, is carried out by means of
a somewhat cumbrous mechanism. No doubt the
“Kaffee-Klatsch” is in great measure justified as a
picture of the tattling society of the little town. It
does not altogether ignore the principle of economy.
But it is curious to note the rapid shrinkage in the
poet’s expositions. Here we have the necessary information
conveyed by a whole party of subsidiary
characters. In the next play, <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>,—we have
still a set exposition, but two characters suffice for it,
and one the heroine. In the next play again—that is
to say, in <cite>Ghosts</cite>—the poet has arrived at his own
peculiar formula, and the exposition is indistinguishably
merged in the action. Still greater is the contrast
between the conclusion of <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> and that
of <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>. It would be too much to call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>Bernick’s conversion and promise to turn over a new
leaf as conventional as the Chamberlain’s right-about-face
in <cite>The League of Youth</cite>. Bernick has passed
through a terrible period of mental agony which may
well have brought home to him a conviction of sin.
Still, the way in which everything suddenly comes
right, Olaf is recovered, the <cite>Indian Girl</cite> is stopped,
Aune is reconciled to the use of the new machines,
and even the weather improves, so as to promise
Johan and Dina a prosperous voyage to America—all
this is a manifest concession to popular
optimism. We are not to conceive, of course, that
the poet deliberately compromised with an artistic
ideal for the sake of popularity, but rather that he
had not yet arrived at the ideal of logical and moral
consistency which he was soon afterwards to attain.
To use his own metaphor, the ghost of the excellent
Eugène Scribe still walked in him. He still instinctively
thought of a play as a storm in a tea-cup,
which must naturally blow over in the allotted two
hours and a half. Even in his next play—so gradual
is the process of evolution—he still makes the external
storm, so to speak, blow over at the appointed
time. But, instead of the general reconciliation and
serenity upon which the curtain falls in <cite>The League
of Youth</cite> and <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>—instead of the
“happy ending” which Helmer so confidently expects—he
gives us that famous scene of Nora’s revolt
and departure, in which he himself may be said to
have made his exit from the school of Scribe, banging
the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>The Norwegian title, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Samfundets Stötter</cite></span>, means
literally <cite>Society’s Pillars</cite>. In the text, the word
“Samfund” has sometimes been translated “society,”
sometimes “community.” The noun <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“stötte,”</span> a pillar,
has for its correlative the verb, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“at stötte,”</span> to support;
so that where the English phrase, “to support
society,” occurs, there is, in the original, a direct
allusion to the title of the play. The leading merchants
in Norwegian seaports often serve as consuls
for one or other foreign Power—whence the title by
which Bernick is addressed. Rörlund, in the original
is called <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“Adjunkt”</span>—that is to say, he is an assistant
master in a school, subordinate to the headmaster or
rector.</p>

<p class='c001'>You think so, young man? H’m; I say no
more. [<i>Draws nearer.</i>] Twenty years ago I was
worth no end of money. My father left me a
great fortune. You’ve heard of my father, I
daresay? No? Old Hans Heire? They called
him Gold Hans. He was a shipowner: made
heaps of money in the blockade time; had his
window-frames and door-posts gilded; he could
afford it——I say no more; so they called him
Gold Hans.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Didn’t he gild his chimney-pots too?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No; that was only a penny-a-liner’s lie; invented
long before your time, however. But he
made the money fly; and so did I in my time.
My visit to London, for instance—haven’t you
heard of my visit to London? I took a prince’s
retinue with me. Have you really not heard of
it, eh? And the sums I have lavished on art and
science! And on bringing rising talent to the
front!</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes; I want to stretch my legs a bit. <span class='float-right'>[<i>Goes.</i></span></p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Speaking low.</i>] He was one of them—just as
grateful as the rest, hee-hee! Do you know, I
kept him a whole year at college?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Like young Monsen. He made nothing of it;
also like——I say no more. Had to give him
up, you see; he had already developed his
unhappy taste for spirits——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But you’ve forgotten what you were going to

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, it’s a complicated business. When my
father was in his glory, things were going downhill
with the old Chamberlain—this one’s father,
you understand; he was a Chamberlain too.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Including the social graces——I say no more.
The conversion of the currency, rash speculations,
extravagances he launched out into, in the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>1816 or thereabouts, forced him to sell some of
his land.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And your father bought it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Bought and paid for it. Well, what then? I
come into my property; I make improvements
by the thousand——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bastian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Your health, my young friend!—Improvements
by the thousand, I say—thinning the woods,
and so forth. Years pass; and then comes
Master Reynard—the present one, I mean—and
repudiates the bargain!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, my dear Mr. Heire, you could surely have
snapped your fingers at him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not so easily! Some small formalities had
been overlooked, he declared. Besides, I happened
then to be in temporary difficulties, which
afterwards became permanent. And what can a
man do nowadays without capital?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You’re right there, by God! And in many
ways you can’t do very much <em class='gesperrt'>with</em> capital either.
That I know to my cost. Why, even my innocent
children——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><span class='sc'>Bastian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Thumps the table.</i>] Ugh, father! if I only had
certain people here!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Your children, you say?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; take Bastian, for example. Perhaps I
haven’t given him a good education?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A threefold education! First for the University;
then for painting; and then for—what is
it?—it’s a civil engineer he is now, isn’t it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bastian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that I am, by the Lord!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that he is; I can produce his bills and his
certificates to prove it! But who gets the town
business? Who has got the local road-making—especially
these last two years? Foreigners, or
at any rate strangers—in short, people no one
knows anything about!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; it’s shameful the way things go on.
Only last New Year, when the managership of
the Savings Bank fell vacant, what must they do
but give Monsen the go-by, and choose an individual
that knew—[<i>Coughs</i>]—that knew how to
keep his purse-strings drawn—which our princely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>host obviously does not. Whenever there’s a
post of confidence going, it’s always the same!
Never Monsen—always some one that enjoys the
confidence—of the people in power. Well, well;
<i>commune suffragium</i>, as the Roman Law puts it;
that means shipwreck in the Common Council,
sir.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> It’s a shame! Your health!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thanks! But, to change the subject—how are
all your law-suits getting on?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They are still pending; I can say no more for
the present. What endless annoyance they do
give me! Next week I shall have to summon
the whole Town Council before the Arbitration
Commission.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To build up? We have to tear down first.— Fieldbo,
I had once a dream—or did I see it?
No; it was a dream, but such a vivid one! I
thought the Day of Judgment was come upon
the world. I could see the whole curve of the
hemisphere. There was no sun, only a livid
storm-light. A tempest arose; it came rushing
from the west and swept everything before it:
first withered leaves, then men; but they kept
on their feet all the time, and their garments
clung fast to them, so that they seemed to be
hurried along sitting. At first they looked like
townspeople running after their hats in a wind;
but when they came nearer they were emperors
and kings; and it was their crowns and orbs they
were chasing and catching at, and seemed always
on the point of grasping, but never grasped. Oh,
there were hundreds and hundreds of them, and
none of them understood in the least what was
happening; but many bewailed themselves, and
asked: “Whence can it come, this terrible
<a id='corr36.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='storm'>storm?”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_36.30'><ins class='correction' title='storm'>storm?”</ins></a></span> Then there came the answer: “One
Voice spoke, and the storm is the echo of that
one Voice.”</p>

You will be the Voice, you say. Good! But
where will you be the Voice? Here in the parish?
Or at most here in the county! And who will
echo you and raise the storm? Why, people like
Monsen and Aslaksen, and that fat-headed genius,
Mr. Bastian. And instead of the flying emperors
and kings, we shall see old Lundestad rushing
about after his lost seat in Parliament. Then
what will it all amount to? Just what you at
first saw in your dreamf—townsfolk in a wind.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well; what do you want to see?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You’ve been drinking to-day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, and yesterday too.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, yesterday there was some excuse for it;
but to-day——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What about your friends in there, then? Aren’t
they drinking too?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, my dear Aslaksen; that’s a fair retort; but
circumstances differ so in this world.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I didn’t choose my circumstances.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No; God chose them for you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, he didn’t—men chose them. Daniel Heire
chose, when he took me from the printing-house
and sent me to college. And Chamberlain Bratsberg
chose, when he ruined Daniel Heire and
sent me back to the printing-house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now you know that’s not true. The Chamberlain
did not ruin Daniel Heire; Daniel Heire
ruined himself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps! But how dared Daniel Heire ruin
himself, in the face of his responsibilities towards
me? God’s partly to blame too, of course. Why
should he give me talent and ability? Well, of
course I could have turned them to account as a
respectable handicraftsman; but then comes that
tattling old fool——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It’s base of you to say that. Daniel Heire acted
with the best intentions.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What good do his “best intentions” do me?
You hear them in there, clinking glasses and
drinking healths? Well, I too have sat at that
table in my day, dressed in purple and fine linen,
like the best of them——! That was just the thing
for me, that was—for me, that had read so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and had thirsted so long to have my share in all
the good things of life. Well, well; how long
was Jeppe in Paradise?<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Smash, crash! down
you go—and my fine fortunes fell to pie, as we

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, after all, you were not so badly off; you
had your trade to fall back upon.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s easily said. After getting out of your
class you can’t get into it again. They took the
ground from under my feet, and shoved me out on
the slippery ice—and then they abuse me because
I stumble.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>No; you have no right to.—What a queer
jumble it is! Daniel Heire, and Providence, and
the Chamberlain, and Destiny, and Circumstance—and
I myself in the middle of it! I’ve often

about it; but it’s so cursedly entangled that——[<i>Glances

Yes, that is really so. Daniel Heire was kind
to her in her childhood. She was a youthful
prodigy; she gave concerts when she was only ten
years old. I daresay you have heard her spoken
of—Selma Sjöblom.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, a music-teacher. He came here many years
ago. Musicians, you know, are seldom millionaires;
and their habits are not always calculated to——;
in short, Mr. Heire has always had an eye for
talent; he was struck with the child, and had her
sent to Berlin; and then, when her father was
dead and Heire’s fortunes were on the wane, she
returned to Christiania, where she was of course
taken up by the best people. That was how my
son happened to fall in with her.</p>

in my nature to take the lead in reforms, or to

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Namely, that the Chamberlain is afraid of you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>By heaven, he shall have no reason to be! He
is a gentleman.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That he is.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Isn’t it touching the way the old man has taken
this affair? And how lovely Miss Bratsberg looked
when she brought me the letter!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But look here—they haven’t mentioned the
scene of yesterday, have they?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not a word; they have far too much tact for
that. But I am filled with remorse; I must find
an opportunity of apologising——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I strongly advise you not to! You don’t know
the Chamberlain——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Very well; then my acts shall speak for me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You won’t break with the Stonelee party?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I shall bring about a reconciliation. I have my
League; it’s a power already, you see.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>By-the-bye, while I remember—we were
speaking of Miss Monsen—I advised you to go
in and win——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, there’s no hurry——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But listen; I have been thinking it over: you
had better put all that out of your head.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I believe you are right. If you marry into an
underbred family, you marry the whole tribe of
them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, and there are other reasons——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Monsen is an underbred fellow; I see that now.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, polish is not his strong point.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, indeed it’s not! He goes and speaks ill of
his guests; that’s ungentlemanly. His rooms all
reek of stale tobacco——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear fellow, how is it you haven’t noticed
the stale tobacco before?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It’s the contrast that does it. I made a false
start when I settled here. I fell into the clutches
of a clique, and they bewildered me with their
clamour. But there shall be an end to that! I
won’t go and wear my life out as a tool in the
hands of self-interest or coarse stupidity.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But what will you do with your League?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The League shall remain as it is; it’s founded
on a pretty broad basis. Its purpose is to counteract
noxious influences; and I am just beginning
to realise what side the noxious influences come
from.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But do you think the “Youth” will see it in
the same light?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They <em class='gesperrt'>shall</em>! I have surely a right to expect
fellows like that to bow before my superior insight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But if they won’t?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then they can go their own way. I have done
with them. You don’t suppose I am going to let
my life slip into a wrong groove, and never reach
the goal, for the sake of mere blind, pig-headed
consistency!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What do you call the goal?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A career that gives scope for my talents, and
fulfils my aspirations.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No vague phrases! What do you mean by your
goal?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, to you I can make a clean breast of it.
My goal is this: in the course of time to get into
Parliament, perhaps into the Ministry, and to
marry happily into a family of means and position.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, indeed! And by help of the Chamberlain’s
social connections you intend to——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I intend to reach the goal by my own exertions!
I must and will reach it; and without
help from any one. It will take time, I daresay;
but never mind! Meanwhile I shall enjoy
life here, drinking in beauty and sunshine——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Here?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, here! Here there are fine manners; life
moves gracefully here; the very floors seem laid
to be trodden only by lacquered shoes. Here the
arm-chairs are deep and the ladies sink exquisitely
into them. Here conversation moves lightly and
elegantly, like a game at battledore; here no
blunders come plumping in to make an awkward
silence. Oh, Fieldbo—here I feel for the first
time what distinction means! Yes, we have
indeed an aristocracy of our own; a little circle;
an aristocracy of culture; and to it I will belong.
Don’t you yourself feel the refining influence of
this place? Don’t you feel that wealth here loses
its grossness? When I think of Monsen’s money,
I seem to see piles of fetid bank-notes and greasy
mortgages—but here! here it is shimmering
silver! And the people are the same. Look at
the Chamberlain—what a fine high-bred old
fellow!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He is indeed.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And the son—alert, straightforward, capable!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Certainly.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then the daughter-in-law! Isn’t she a

nature!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thora—Miss Bratsberg has that too.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes; but she is less remarkable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh, you don’t know her. You don’t know how
deep, and steadfast, and true her nature is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But oh, the daughter-in-law! So frank, almost
reckless; and yet so appreciative, so irresistible——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, I really believe you’re in love with her.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>With a married woman? Are you crazy? What
good would <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> do me? No, but I am falling in
love—I can feel that plainly. Yes, she is indeed
deep, and steadfast, and true.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, this is the merest extravagance! Yesterday
it was Miss Monsen——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, I was too hasty about that; besides, you
yourself advised me not to——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I advise you most emphatically to dismiss all
thought of either of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed! Perhaps you yourself think of throwing
the handkerchief to one of them?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I? No, I assure you——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, it wouldn’t have mattered if you had. If
people stand in my way and want to balk me of
my future, why, I stick at nothing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You! What right have you to pose as guardian

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Pooh! that sort of talk won’t do with me. Your
motive is mere self-interest! It gratifies your petty
vanity to imagine yourself cock-of-the-walk in this
house; and so I am to be kept outside the pale.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ho-ho! So you are intriguing against me, are
you? I’m glad I have found it out. I know you
now; you are my enemy, the only one I have here.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed you are! You have always been so, ever
since our school-days. Just look around here and
see how every one appreciates me, stranger as I
am. You, on the other hand, you who know me,
have never appreciated me. That is the radical
weakness of your character—you can never appreciate
any one. What did you do in Christiania but
go about from tea-party to tea-party, spreading
yourself out in little witticisms? That sort of
thing brings its own punishment! You dull your
sense for all that makes life worth living, for all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that is ennobling and inspiring; and presently you
get left behind, fit for nothing.</p>

come into play. What I said about Chamberlain
Bratsberg must be entirely recast before it can

<p class='c001'>Do you know, Mr. Stensgård, that you are doing

    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But you are. Last winter, before you came here,
my paper was looking up. I edited it myself, I
must tell you, and I edited it on a principle.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>You?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I!—I said to myself: it’s the great public
that supports a paper; now the great public is the
bad public—that comes of the local situation; and
the bad public will have a bad paper. So you see
I edited it——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Badly! Yes, that’s undeniable.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, and I prospered by it. But then you came
and brought ideas into the district. The paper
took on a colour, and then Lundestad’s supporters
all fell away. The subscribers that are left won’t
pay their subscriptions——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, but the paper has become a good one.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I can’t live on a good paper. You were to make
things lively; you were to grapple with abuses, as
you promised yesterday. The bigwigs were to be
pilloried; the paper was to be filled with things
people were bound to read—and now, you leave
me in the lurch——</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stensgård, you musn’t drive me to desperation,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I mean that I must make the paper pay in
another way. Heaven knows I should be sorry to
do it. Before you came I made an honest living
out of accidents and suicides and other harmless
things, that often hadn’t even happened. But
now you have turned everything topsy-turvy;
people now want very different fare——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just let me tell you this: if you break loose in
any way, if you go a single step beyond my orders,
and try to exploit the movement in your own dirty
interests, I’ll go to the opposition printer and start
a new paper. We have money, you must know!
We can bring your rag to ruin in a fortnight.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What have <em class='gesperrt'>you</em> to do with him? Do you think
I don’t know why you are invited here? It’s
because he is afraid of you, and of what you may
do; and you are making capital of that. But
if he’s afraid of what you may do, he’ll be no less
afraid of what I may print; and <em>I</em> will make capital
of that!</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, let me say that if any one has

you musn’t believe it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>Oh, nothing; nothing, I assure you. You see,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They are quite natural relations, Mr. Stensgård:
the relation of the old to the new; it is always so.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, come, Mr. Lundestad, you are not so old as

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes indeed, I’m getting old. I have held my seat

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Relieved?</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Times change, you see. New problems arise,
and for their solution we want new forces.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now, frankly, Mr. Lundestad—are you really
going to give up your seat to Monsen?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>To Monsen? No, certainly not to Monsen.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then I don’t understand——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Suppose, now, I did retire in Monsen’s favour:
do you think he would be elected?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It’s hard to say. As the preliminary election
comes on the day after to-morrow, there may
scarcely be time to prepare the public mind;
but——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I don’t believe he would manage it. The
Chamberlain’s party, my party, would not vote for
him. Of course “my party” is a figure of speech;
I mean the men of property, the old families, who
are settled on their own land and belong to it.
They won’t have anything to do with Monsen.
Monsen is a newcomer; no one really knows anything
about Monsen and his affairs. And then he
has had to cut down so much to clear a place for
himself—to fell both trees and men, you may
say.</p>

<p class='c001'>H’m! You are a man of rare gifts, Mr. <span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why not? You have qualified, I hear. And if
you don’t seize this opportunity, then some one
else will come in; and when once he is firm in the
saddle, it may not be so easy to unseat him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Great heavens, Mr. Lundestad! do you really

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Stensgård.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not care about it! Well, I must confess I’m

But do you really think it possible?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, there’s nothing impossible about it. I
should do my best, and so, no doubt, would the
Chamberlain; he knows your oratorical gifts. You
have the young men on your side——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lundestad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, you don’t mean much by that. If you really

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Thanks! Believe me, Mr. Stensgård, you will
not regret it. But now we must go warily to work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>We must both of us take care to be on the electoral

  </div>

<p class='c001'>If we once get so far, we are safe. In the

<p class='c001'>There is a limit to omnipotence. You must of

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now just look at the thing reasonably. What
do we mean when we talk of two parties? We
have, on the one hand, certain men or families
who are in possession of the common civic advantages—I
mean property, independence, and power.
That is the party I belong to. On the other hand,
we have the mass of our younger fellow citizens
who want to share in these advantages. That is
your party. But that party you will quite naturally

<p class='c001'>It was in the spring time. There came a young
cuckoo flying over the uplands. Now the cuckoo
is an adventurer. There was a great Bird-Parliament
on the meadow beneath him, and both wild
and tame fowl flocked to it. They came tripping
out of the hen-yards; they waddled up from the
goose-ponds; down, from Stonelee hulked a fat
capercailzie, flying low and noisily; he settled
down, and ruffled his feathers and flapped his wings,
and made himself even broader than he was; and
every now and then he crowed: “Krak, krak,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>krak!” as much as to say: I’m the game-cock from
Stonelee, I am!</p>

<p class='c001'>And then there was an old woodpecker. He
bustled up and down the tree-trunks, pecking with
his pointed beak, and gorging himself with grubs
and everything that turns to gall. To right and
left you heard him going: prik, prik, prik! And
that was the woodpecker.</p>

<p class='c001'>That was the old woodpecker. But now there
came life into the crew; for they found something
to cackle evil about. And they flustered together,

bugbear to the neighbourhood,” croaked a hoarse
raven. But the eagle swooped down into their
midst, seized the cuckoo, and bore him aloft to
his eyrie.—Heart conquered heart! From that
clear summit the adventurer-cuckoo looked far
and wide over the lowlands; there he found sunshine
and peace; and there he learned to judge
aright the swarm from the hen-yards and the
clearings——</p>

<p class='c001'>But I’ve had to work for it, Chamberlain. Oh,
I know you regard my work with no very friendly

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The luck has been on my side, I may tell you.
I’ve gone ahead as far as I care to; so now I
think it’s about time to slack off a little——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I congratulate both you—and other

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>And if I could at the same time do you a

</div>

<p class='c001'>When the Langerud woods were put up to

them——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but you outbade me, and they were

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>After all your sinful cutting and hacking——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, they’re worth a good deal still; and with
your method of working, in a few years——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thank you; unfortunately I must decline the
proposal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There’s a great deal of money in it, Chamberlain.
As for me,—I may tell you I have a
great speculation on hand; the stakes are large;
I mean there’s a big haul to be made—a hundred
thousand or so——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A hundred thousand? That is certainly no
trifle.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ha ha ha! A nice round sum to add to the pile.
But when you’re going into a great battle you
need reserve forces, as the saying goes. There’s
not much ready money about; the names that
are worth anything are rather used up——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, certain people have taken care of <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It’s a case of you scratch me, I scratch you.
Well, Chamberlain, is it to be a bargain? You
shall have the woods at your own figure——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I will not have them at any figure, Mr. Monsen.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, one good offer deserves another. Will
you help me, sir?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What do you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course I’ll give good security. I have plenty
of property. Look here—these papers—just let
me explain my position to you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Waving the papers aside.</i>] Is it pecuniary aid
you want?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not ready money; oh, no! But your support,
Chamberlain. Of course I’ll pay for it—and give
security, and——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you come to me with such a proposal as
this?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, precisely to you. I know you’ve often let
bygones be bygones when a man was in real
straits.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, in a way, I must thank you for your good
opinion—especially at a time like this; but nevertheless——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Won’t you tell me, Chamberlain, what sets you
against me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, what would be the use?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It might lead to a better understanding between
us. I’ve never stood in your way that I
know of.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You think not? Then let me tell you of one
case in which you have stood in my way. I
founded the Iron-works Savings Bank for the
benefit of my employees and others. But then
you must needs set up as a banker; people take
their savings to you——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Naturally, sir, for I give higher interest.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but you charge higher interest on <a id='corr116.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='loans'>loans.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_116.24'><ins class='correction' title='loans'>loans.</ins></a></span></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But I don’t make so many difficulties about
security and so forth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is just the mischief of it; for now we have
people making bargains to the tune of ten or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>twenty thousand dollars,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> though neither of the
parties has so much as a brass farthing. That is
what sets me against you, Mr. Monsen. And
there is another thing too that touches me still
more nearly. Do you think it was with my good
will that my son flung himself into all these wild
speculations?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But how can I help that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was your example that infected him, as it
did the others. Why could you not stick to your
last?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Remain a lumberman, like my father?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Was it a disgrace to be in my employment?
Your father made his bread honourably, and was
respected in his own class.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, until he’d almost worked his life out, and
at last went over the waterfall with his raft. Do
you know anything of life in that class, Chamberlain?
Have you ever realised what the men have
to endure who toil for you deep in the forests, and
along the river-reaches, while you sit comfortably
at home and fatten on the profits? Can you blame
such a man for struggling to rise in the world? I
had had a little more schooling than my father;
perhaps I had rather more brains too——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Very likely. But by what means have you
risen in the world? You began by selling brandy.
Then you bought up doubtful debts, and enforced
them mercilessly;—and so you got on and on.
How many people have you not ruined to push
yourself forward!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s the course of business; one up, another
down.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But there are different methods of business. I
know of respectable families whom you have
brought to the workhouse.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Daniel Heire is not very far from the workhouse.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I understand you; but I can justify my conduct
before God and man! When the country was in
distress, after the separation from Denmark, my
father made sacrifices beyond his means. Thus
part of our property came into the hands of the
Heire family. What was the result? The people
who lived upon the property suffered under
Daniel Heire’s incompetent management. He
cut down timber to the injury, I may even say to
the ruin, of the district. Was it not my obvious
duty to put a stop to it if I was able? And it
happened that I <em class='gesperrt'>was</em> able; I had the law on my
side; I was well within my rights when I re-entered
upon my family property.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I, too, have always had the law on my side.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But what about your sense of right, your conscience,
if you have such a thing? And how you
have broken down all social order! How you
have impaired the respect that should attach to
wealth! People never think of asking nowadays
how such and such a fortune was made, or how
long it has been in such and such a family; they
only ask: how much is so-and-so worth?—and
they esteem him accordingly. Now I suffer by all
this; I find myself regarded as a sort of associate
of yours; people speak of us in one breath, because
we are the two largest proprietors in the
neighbourhood. This state of things I cannot
endure! I tell you once for all: that is why I am
set against you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Monsen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This state of things shall come to an end, sir;
I will give up business, and make way for you at
every point; but I beg you, I implore you, to help
me!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c001'>Yes, he’s in it. I reckon he stands to win some

glowed with a noble indignation, if I may say so, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>having to stand by and see——I say no more!

Monsen will go to prison; young Bratsberg will
compound with his creditors; and the Chamberlain
will be placed under trustees; that’s to say,
his creditors will present him with an annuity of a
couple of thousand dollars. That’s how things go,

quite different in their habits and acts.
Just look at Stensgård——</p>

<p class='c001'>A patchwork. I have known him from childhood.
His father was a mere rag of a man, a
withered weed, a nobody. He kept a little
huckster’s shop, and eked things out with pawn-broking;
or rather his wife did for him. She was a
coarse-grained woman, the most unwomanly I ever
knew. She had her husband declared incapable;<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
she had not an ounce of heart in her. And in that
home Stensgård passed his childhood. Then he
went to the grammar-school. “He shall go to
college,” said his mother; “I’ll make a smart
solicitor of him.” Squalor at home, high-pressure
at school; soul, temperament, will, talents, all
pulling in different ways—what could it lead to
but disintegration of character?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Chamberlain.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What could it lead to, eh? I should like to
know what is good enough for you. We are to
expect nothing of Stensgård; nothing of my son;
but we may look to you, I suppose—to you——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, to me—precisely. Oh, you needn’t laugh;
I take no credit to myself; but my lot has been
one that begets equilibrium and firmness of character.
I was brought up amid the peace and
harmony of a modest middle-class home. My
mother is a woman of the finest type; in our
home we had no desires that outstripped our
opportunities, no cravings that were wrecked on
the rocks of circumstance; and death did not
break in upon our circle, leaving emptiness and
longing behind it. We were brought up in the
love of beauty, but it informed our whole view of
life, instead of being a side-interest, a thing apart.
We were taught to shun excesses, whether of the
intellect or of the feelings——</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Thora</span>.] Yes, I can tell you he’s cost me
many a tear, that bad man. But now I thank the
Lord for Bastian. The other was false as the
sea-foam; and then he’s a terrible smoker, Miss
Bratsberg, and frightfully particular about his
meals. I found him a regular gourmand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Come along, then, all of you. Mr. Lundestad,
you shall sit beside me; and you too, Mr. Aslaksen.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; and perhaps an old man may be allowed

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; you’ll see, gentlemen! In ten or fifteen
years, Stensgård will either be in Parliament or
in the Ministry—perhaps in both at once.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In ten or fifteen years? Perhaps; but then
he can scarcely stand at the head of the League
of Youth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why not?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, because by that time his youth will be—questionable.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Heire.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then he can stand at the head of the Questionable
League, sir. That’s what Lundestad means.
He says like Napoleon—“It’s the questionable
people that make politicians”; hee-hee!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Fieldbo.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, after all is said and done, <em class='gesperrt'>our</em> League
shall last through young days and questionable
days as well; and it shall continue to be the
League of Youth. When Stensgård founded his
League, and was carried shoulder-high amid all
the enthusiasm of Independence Day, he said—“Providence
is on the side of the League of
Youth.” I think even Mr. Helle, theologian as
he is, will let us apply that saying to ourselves.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ACT FIRST.</h3>

<p class='c017'><i>A spacious garden-room in</i> <span class='sc'>Consul Bernick’s</span> <i>house.
In front, to the left, a door lends into the Consul’s
office; farther back, in the same wall, a similar
door. In the middle of the opposite wall is a
large entrance door. The back wall is almost
entirely composed of plate-glass, with an open
doorway leading to a broad flight of steps,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> over
which a sun-shade is let down. Beyond the
steps a part of the garden can be seen, enclosed
by a railing with a little gate. Beyond the
railing, and running parallel with it, is a street
of small, brightly painted wooden houses. It is
summer, and the sun shines warmly. Now and
then people pass along the street: they stop and
speak to each other: customers come and go at
the little corner shop, and so forth.</i></p>

<p class='c018'><i>In the garden-room a number of ladies are gathered
round a table. At the head of the table sits</i>
<span class='sc'>Mrs. Bernick</span>. <i>On her left sit</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt</span>
<i>and her daughter; next to them,</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs.</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Miss
Rummel</span>. <i>On</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Bernick’s</span> <i>right sit</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Lynge</span>, <span class='sc'>Miss Bernick (Martha)</span>, <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Dina
Dorf</span>. <i>All the ladies are busy sewing. On the
table lie large heaps of half-finished and cut-out
linen, and other articles of clothing. Farther
back, at a little table on which are two flower-pots
and a glass of</i> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau sucré</span>, <i>sits</i> <span class='sc'>Doctor Rörlund</span>,
<i>reading from a book with gilt edges, a
word here and there being heard by the audience.
Out in the garden</i> <span class='sc'>Olaf Bernick</span> <i>is running
about, shooting at marks with a crossbow.</i></p>

<p class='c018'><i>Presently</i> <span class='sc'>Aune</span>, <i>the foreman shipbuilder, enters
quietly by the door on the right. The reading
ceases for a moment;</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Bernick</span> <i>nods to
him and points to the left-hand door.</i> <span class='sc'>Aune</span> <i>goes
quietly to the Consul’s door, knocks softly, pauses
a moment, then knocks again.</i> <span class='sc'>Krap</span>, <i>the Consul’s
clerk, opens the door and comes out with his hat
in his hand and papers under his arm.</i></p>

  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krap.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krap.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not to make the men useless in work-time.
Last Saturday you must needs hold forth about
the harm that will be done to the workmen by
our machines and new method of work. What
makes you do that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aune.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I do it to support society.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krap.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s an odd notion! The Consul says you are
undermining society.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aune.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My “society” is not the Consul’s “society,”
Mr. Krap! Seeing as I’m the foreman of the
Industrial Society, I have to——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krap.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Your first duty is as foreman of Consul Bernick’s
shipyard. Your first duty is to the society called
Bernick &amp; Co., for by it we all live.—Well, now
you know what the Consul wanted to say to you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aune.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The Consul wouldn’t have said it like that, Mr.
Krap! But I know well enough what I’ve got to
thank for this. It’s that cursèd American that
has put in for repairs. These people think work
can be done here as they do it over there, and
that——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krap.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well—I have no time to go into generalities.
I have told you the Consul’s wishes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>that is enough. Now you had better go down to
the yard again; you’re sure to be wanted; I shall
be down myself presently.—I beg your pardon,
ladies!</p>

<div class='direction'>
<p class='c019'>[<i>He bows, and goes out through the garden
and down the street.</i> <span class='sc'>Aune</span> <i>goes quietly

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rörlund.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; it forms a refreshing contrast to what we
unhappily see every day, both in newspapers and
magazines. The rouged and gilded exterior
flaunted by the great communities—what does it
really conceal? Hollowness and rottenness, if I
may say so. They have no moral foundation
under their feet. In one word—they are whited
sepulchres, these great communities of the modern
world.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Rörlund.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, I won’t speak of such scum of humanity.
But even in the higher classes—how do matters
stand? Doubt and fermenting unrest on every
side; the soul at war with itself; insecurity in
every relation of life. See how the family is
undermined!—how a brazen spirit of subversion
is assailing the most vital truths!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It would scarcely be for our good if such “great
things” came into fashion among us. No; we
ought to thank God that our lot is ordered as it is.
A tare, alas! will now and then spring up among the
wheat; but we honestly do our best to weed it out.
The great point, ladies, is to keep society pure—to
exclude from it all the questionable elements
which an impatient age would force upon us.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And yet the papers said such horrid things

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Drawing his chair nearer.</i>] Pray don’t speak of
it, dear lady. Do not all of you make sacrifices
for a good cause? And do you not make them
willingly and gladly? The Lapsed and Lost, for
whom we are working, are like wounded soldiers
on a battlefield; you, ladies, are the Red Cross
Guild, the Sisters of Mercy, who pick lint for these
unhappy sufferers, tie the bandages gently round
the wounds, dress, and heal them——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rörlund.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The gift is largely inborn; but it can in some
measure be acquired. The great point is to see
things in the light of a serious vocation. What
do <em class='gesperrt'>you</em> say, Miss Bernick? Do you not find that
you have, as it were, firmer ground under your
feet since you have devoted your life to your
school-work?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Martha.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>I scarcely know what to say. Often, when I

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rörlund.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes; that is temptation, my dear Miss
Bernick. You must bar the door against such an
unquiet guest. The stormy sea—of course you
do not mean that literally; you mean the great
billowing world, where so many go to wreck.
And do you really find so much to attract you in
the life you hear rushing and surging outside?
Just look out into the street. Look at the people
in the sweltering sunshine, toiling and moiling
over their paltry affairs! Ours, surely, is the
better part, sitting here in the pleasant shade, and
turning our backs toward the quarter from which
disturbance might arise.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, it was a sort of—what shall I call it?—a
sort of a—with Dina’s mother. Oh, I remember
it as if it were yesterday. Johan Tönnesen was
in old Mrs. Bernick’s office; Karsten Bernick had
just come home from Paris—it was before his

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you see, that winter Möller’s comedy

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>——and in the company were Dorf and his wife.

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, heaven knows what they could see in her.

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Lynge.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For afterwards something else was found out,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I really must say——! Wasn’t it known

old Mrs. Bernick on the point of going bankrupt?
Rummel himself has told me that. But heaven

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, the money didn’t go to Madam Dorf, at

<p class='c001'>Yes, what became of Dina’s parents?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, Dorf deserted both wife and child. But
Madam was impudent enough to remain here a
whole year. She didn’t dare to show herself in
the theatre again; but she made a living by washing
and sewing——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And she tried to set up a dancing-school.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course it was a failure. What parents could
trust their children with such a person? But she
could not hold out long; the fine Madam wasn’t
accustomed to work, you see; some chest trouble
set in, and carried her off.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Lynge.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, you may believe it has been a terrible
thing for the Bernicks. It is the dark spot on
the sun of their happiness, as Rummel once expressed
it. So you must never talk of these
things in <em class='gesperrt'>this</em> house again, Mrs. Lynge.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, by-the-bye, Mrs. Bernick has a step-sister

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Lynge.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I’ll tell you all about it, Mrs. Lynge. Bernick
had just proposed to Betty Tönnesen; and as he
was coming, with her on his arm, into her aunt’s
room to announce the engagement to her——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The Tönnesens were orphans, you understand.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>——Lona Hessel rose from her chair, and gave
the handsome, aristocratic Karsten Bernick a
ringing box on the ear!</p>

  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that was just it. She imagined he was

from Paris.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Lona Hessel, too, is certainly a sun-spot in
the Bernicks’ happiness. But now you know the
whole story, Mrs. Lynge. Heaven knows, I have
only told it to put you on your guard as to what
you say.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Lynge.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You may be quite easy on that point. But poor

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Rummel.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, for her it was an absolute stroke of luck.
Only think, if she had remained in her parents’
hands! Of course we all took an interest in her,
and tried to instil good principles into her mind.
At last Miss Bernick arranged that she should
come and live here.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Holt.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But she has always been a difficult girl to deal
with—the effect of bad example, you know. Of

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, for my part, I cannot but regard it as a
special guidance that sent me up country on
business this spring, and led me by chance into
a valley where I had never been before. It struck
me like a flash of lightning that here was the
very track for a branch line. I at once sent an
engineer to inspect it; I have here the provisional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>calculations and estimates; nothing now stands
in our way.</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Still standing, along with the other ladies, at the

    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, my good Betty, you would not have seen
the situation in its true light. Besides, I have
spoken of it to no living creature until to-day.
But now the decisive moment has come; now we
must go to work openly, and with all our might.
Ay, if I have to risk all I possess in the affair, I am
determined to see it through.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, indeed we do. What a stimulus it will
give to our whole community! Think of the
great tracts of forest it will bring within reach,
think of all the rich mineral-seams it will allow
us to work; think of the river, with its one waterfall
above the other! What rare advantages for
manufactures of all kinds!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No; make your mind easy, Doctor. Our busy
little town now rests, heaven be thanked, on a
sound moral foundation; we have all helped to
drain it, if I may say so; and that we will continue
to do, each in his own way. You, Doctor, will
carry on your beneficent activity in the school and
in the home. We, the practical men of business,
will support society by furthering the welfare of
as wide a circle as possible. And our women—yes,
come nearer, ladies; I am glad that you
should hear—our women, I say, our wives and
daughters, will proceed unwearied in their charitable
labours, and be a help and comfort to those

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aune.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The American? I sort of understood that we
was to do all we could to get your own ship out

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have given you no reason for such an idea.
You should have made all possible progress with
the American too; but you have done nothing.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is not the real reason. Krap has told me
the whole truth. You don’t understand how to
work the new machines I have introduced—or
rather, you <em class='gesperrt'>won’t</em> work with them.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They are quite inadequate nowadays. You
mustn’t think, Aune, that it’s a question of mere
profit; luckily I could do without that; but I
must consider the community I live in, and the
business I have to manage. It is from me that
progress must come, or it will never come at
all.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, for your own narrow circle, for the working
class. Oh, I know all about your agitations!
You make speeches; you stir people up; but
when it comes to a tangible piece of progress, as
in the case of the machines, you will have nothing
to do with it; you are afraid.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aune.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I’m afraid, Consul; I’m afraid for the
hundreds of poor folks as the machines’ll take the
bread out of their mouths. You talk a deal of
duty towards Society, Consul, but it seems to me
as Society has duties of its own as well. What
business have science and capital to bring all
these new-fangled inventions into the field before
Society has turned out a breed of men that can
use them?</p>

again. The ruffianly crew turn the

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And who gets the blame of all this? It is I—yes,

should succeed in shaking people’s unqualified

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Coming nearer.</i>] Consul Bernick, have you
rightly bethought what it means to turn an old
workman away? You say he can look about for
another job. Ay, ay, maybe he can—but is that
everything? Ah, you should just see what it looks
like in a turned-off workman’s house, the night
when he comes home and puts his tool-chest
behind the door.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you think I part with you willingly?
Haven’t I always been a good master to you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span><span class='sc'>Aune.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So much the worse, Consul; for that means as
my folks at home won’t put the blame on <em class='gesperrt'>you</em>.
They won’t say nothing to me, for they durstn’t,
but they’ll look at me when I’m not noticing, as
much as to say: Certain sure, it must’a’ been his
fault. You see, it’s that—it’s that as I can’t abear,
God knows, I’m a poor man, but I’ve always been
used to be the first in my own house. My bit of a
home is in a manner of speaking a little community,
Consul Bernick. That little community
I’ve been able to support and hold together
because my wife believed in me, my children
believed in me. And now the whole thing is to
fall to pieces.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, if it cannot be otherwise, the less must
fall before the greater; the part must, in heaven’s
name, be sacrificed to the whole. I can give you
no other answer; and you’ll find it is the way of
the world. But you are an obstinate fellow,
Aune! You stand against me, not because you
can’t help it, but because you <em class='gesperrt'>will</em> not prove the
superiority of machinery to manual labour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aune.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you’re so dead set on this, Consul, because
you know that, if you send me about my business,
leastways you’ll have shown the papers your
goodwill.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What if it were so? I have told you how much
it means to me—I must either conciliate the
papers, or have them all attacking me at the
moment when I am working for a great and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>beneficent cause. What follows? Can I possibly
act otherwise than I am doing? Would you have
me, in order to hold your home together, as you
call it, sacrifice hundreds of other homes—homes
that will never be founded, will never have a
smoking hearthstone, if I do not succeed in my
present enterprise? You must make your choice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, and the guilty one was the obvious person.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Stop! <em class='gesperrt'>Then</em> the obvious person was the innocent
one. I was alone, free, an orphan; it was a
positive blessing to me to escape from the grind
of the office. You, on the other hand, had your
mother still living; and, besides, you had just
got secretly engaged to Betty, and she was
devoted to you. What would have become of
her if she had learnt——?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And was it not just for Betty’s sake that you
broke off the entanglement with Madam Dorf?
It was for the very purpose of putting an end to
it that you were up at her house that night——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, the fatal night when that drunken brute
came home——! Yes, Johan, it was for Betty’s
sake; but yet—that you should have the
generosity to turn appearances against yourself
and go away——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You need have no qualms, my dear Karsten.
We agreed that it should be so; you had to be
saved, and you were my friend. I can tell you I
was proud of that friendship! Here was I, poor
stay-at-home, plodding along, when you came
back like a very prince from your great foreign
tour—from London and Paris, no less! Then
what should you do but choose me for your bosom
friend, though I was four years younger than you.
Well, that was because you were making love to
Betty; <em class='gesperrt'>now</em> I understand it well enough. But
how proud I was of it then! And who would
not have been proud! Who would not gladly
have served as your scapegoat, especially when it
only meant a month’s town-talk, and an excuse for
making a dash into the wide world.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m—my dear Johan, I must tell you frankly
that the story is not so entirely forgotten yet.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Isn’t it? Well, what does it matter to me
when once I am back again at my farm?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then you are going back?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But not so very soon, I hope?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>As soon as possible. It was only to please
Lona that I came over at all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed! How so?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you see, Lona is not so young as she once
was, and for some time past a sort of home-sickness
has come over her, though she would never
admit it. [<i>Smiling.</i>] She dared not leave behind
her a scapegrace like me, who, before I was out of
my teens, had been mixed up in——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, Karsten, now I must make a confession I
am really ashamed of.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You haven’t told her the whole story?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I have. It was wrong of me, but I couldn’t
help it. You have no conception what Lona has
been to me. You could never endure her; but to
me she has been a mother. The first few years
over there, when we were desperately poor—oh,
how she worked! And when I had a long illness,
and could earn nothing, and couldn’t keep her
from doing it, she took to singing songs in the
cafés; gave lectures that people laughed at;
wrote a book she has both laughed and cried over
since—and all to keep my soul and body together.
Last winter, when I saw her pining for home, and
thought how she had toiled and slaved for me,
could I sit still and look on? No, Karsten, I
couldn’t. I said, “Go, go, Lona; don’t be
anxious on my account. I’m not such a ne’er-do-well
as you think.” And then—then I told her
everything.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And how did she take it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, she said what was quite true—that as I was
innocent I could have no objection to taking a trip
over here myself. But you needn’t be afraid;
Lona will say nothing, and I shall take better care
of my own tongue another time.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes; I am sure you will.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Here is my hand upon it. And now don’t let
us talk any more of that old story; fortunately it
is the only escapade either you or I have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>mixed up in, I hope. And now I mean thoroughly
to enjoy the few days I shall have here. You
can’t think what a splendid walk we have had this
forenoon. Who could have imagined that the
little baggage that used to trot about and play
angels in the theatre——! But tell me—what
became of her parents afterwards?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, there’s nothing to tell except what I wrote
you immediately after you left. You got my two
letters, of course?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course, of course; I have them both. The
drunken scoundrel deserted her?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And was afterwards killed in a drinking-bout.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And she herself died soon after? I suppose
you did all you could for her without exciting
attention?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>She was proud; she betrayed nothing, but she
would accept nothing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, at any rate, you did right in taking Dina
into your house.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, yes—— However, it was really Martha
that arranged that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, it was Martha? By-the-bye, where is
Martha to-day?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, she is always busy either at the school, or
among her sick people.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then it was Martha that took charge of Dina?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; education has always been Martha’s
hobby. That is why she accepted a place in the
national school. It was a piece of folly on her part.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>She certainly looked very much done up yesterday.
I should scarcely think her health would
stand it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, I don’t think there’s much amiss with her
health. But it’s unpleasant for me. It looks as
if I, her brother, were not willing to maintain her.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Maintain her? I thought she had enough of
her own to——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not a halfpenny. I daresay you remember what
difficulties my mother was in when you left. She
got on for some time with my help; but of course
that arrangement could not permanently satisfy
me. So I determined to go into partnership with
her; but even then things were far from going
well. At last I had to take over the whole affair;
and when we came to make up accounts, there
was scarcely anything left to my mother’s share.
Then, shortly afterwards, she died; and Martha,
of course, was left with nothing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poor Martha!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poor! Why so? You don’t suppose I let her
want for anything? Oh no; I think I may say
I am a good brother to her. Of course she lives
here and has her meals with us; her salary as a
teacher is quite enough for her dress, and—what
can a single woman want more?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m; that’s not the way we think in America.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I daresay not; there are too many agitators
at work over there. But here, in our little circle,
where, thank heaven, corruption has not as yet
managed to creep in—here women are content
with a modest and unobtrusive position. For the
rest, it is Martha’s own fault; she could have been
provided for long ago if she had cared to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You mean she could have married?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, and married very well too; she has had
several good offers. Strangely enough!—a woman
without money, no longer young, and quite insignificant.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Insignificant?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, I am not blaming her at all. Indeed, I
would not have her otherwise. In a large house
like ours, you know, it is always convenient to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>have some steady-going person like her, whom one
can put to anything that may turn up.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but she herself——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>She herself? What do you mean? Oh, of
course she has plenty to interest herself in—Betty,
and Olaf, and me, you know. People ought
not to think of themselves first; women least of
all. We have each our community, great or small,
to support and work for. I do so, at any rate.

you see that girl playing on the lawn with Olaf?
That is Dina. Do you remember that confused
letter you wrote me when you went away? You
asked me to believe in you. I <em class='gesperrt'>have</em> believed
in you, Johan. All the bad things that there
were rumours of afterwards must have been

place here, I, your old playfellow. The duties
you forgot, or could not fulfil, I have fulfilled for
you. I tell you this, that you may have the less
to reproach yourself with. I have been a mother
to that much-wronged child; I have brought her
up as well as I could——</p>

courage to think freely and greatly yourself.
Perhaps you found in me a little more character,

to make sure of the money.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you tell me this to my face!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I do. Hear me, Lona——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And yet you wrote me that an irresistible
passion for Betty had seized you, appealed to my
magnanimity, conjured me for Betty’s sake to say
nothing of what had passed between us——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had to, I tell you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now, by all that’s holy, I am not sorry I forgot
myself as I did that day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Let me tell you, calmly and deliberately, what
my position was at that time. My mother, you
know, stood at the head of the business; but
she had no business capacity. I was hurriedly
called home from Paris; the times were critical;
I was to retrieve the situation. What did I find?
I found—and this, remember, had to be kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>strictly secret—a house as good as ruined. Yes,
it was as good as ruined, the old, respected house,
that had stood through three generations. What
could I, the son, the only son, do, but cast about
me for a means of saving it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So you saved the house of Bernick at the
expense of a woman.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You know very well that Betty loved me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But I?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Believe me, Lona, you would never have been
happy with me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Was it your care for my happiness that made
you play me false?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you think it was from selfish motives that I
acted as I did? If I had stood alone then, I
would have begun the world again, bravely and
cheerfully. But you don’t understand how the
head of a great house becomes a living part of the
business he inherits, with its enormous responsibility.
Do you know that the welfare of hundreds,
ay of thousands, depends upon him? Can you
not consider that it would have been nothing short
of a disaster to the whole community, which both
you and I call our home, if the house of Bernick
had fallen?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Is it for the sake of the community, then, that
for these fifteen years you have stood upon a lie?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A lie?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How much does Betty know of all that lay
beneath and before her marriage with you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Can you think that I would wound her to no
purpose by telling her these things?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>To no purpose, you say? Well well, you are a
business man; you should understand what is to
the purpose.—But listen, Karsten: I, too, will
speak calmly and deliberately. Tell me—after
all, are you really happy?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In my family, do you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I am indeed, Lona. Oh, you have not sacrificed
yourself in vain. I can say truly that I have
grown happier year by year. Betty is so good
and docile. In the course of years she has learnt
to mould her character to what is peculiar in
mine——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>At first, it is true, she had some high-flown
notions about love; she could not reconcile herself
to the thought that, little by little, it must
pass over into a placid friendship.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But she is quite reconciled to that now?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Entirely. You may guess that daily intercourse
with me has not been without a ripening influence
upon her. People must learn to moderate their
mutual claims if they are to fulfil their duties in
the community in which they are placed. Betty
has by degrees come to understand this, so that
our house is now a model for our fellow citizens.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But these fellow citizens know nothing of the
lie?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of the lie?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, of the lie upon which you have stood for
these fifteen years.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You call that——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I call it the lie—the threefold lie. First the
lie towards me; then the lie towards Betty; then
the lie towards Johan.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Betty has never asked me to speak.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Because she has known nothing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And <em class='gesperrt'>you</em> will not ask me to;—out of consideration
for her, you will not.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, no; I daresay I shall manage to bear all the
ridicule; I have a broad back.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And Johan will not ask me either—he has
promised me that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But you yourself, Karsten? Is there not something
within you that longs to get clear of the lie?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You would have me voluntarily sacrifice my
domestic happiness and my position in society!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What right have you to stand where you are
standing?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For fifteen years I have every day earned a
clearer right—by my whole life, by all I have
laboured for, by all I have achieved.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, you have laboured for much and achieved
much, both for yourself and others. You are the
richest and most influential man in the town; they
have to bow before your will, all of them, because
you are held to be a man without stain or flaw—your
home is a model, your life is a model. But
all this magnificence, and you yourself along with
it, stand on a trembling quicksand. A moment
may come, a word may be spoken—and, if you
do not save yourself in time, you and all your
grandeur go to the bottom.</p>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Revenge! You want to revenge yourself. I

There is only <em class='gesperrt'>one</em> who has a right to speak, and

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Johan. If any one else accuses me, I shall
deny everything. If you try to crush me, I shall
fight for my life. You will never succeed, I tell
you! He who could destroy me will not speak—and
he is going away again.</p>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>Why, about the great buying-up of property

<p class='c001'>What do you mean? Is there any such rumour
about?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hilmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, over the whole town. I heard it at the
club. They say that one of our lawyers has been
secretly commissioned to buy up all the forests,
all the mining rights, all the water-power——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And is it known for whom?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hilmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They thought at the club that it must be for a
syndicate from some other town that had got wind
of your scheme, and had rushed in before the
prices rose. Isn’t it disgraceful? Ugh!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Disgraceful?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hilmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that outsiders should trespass on our preserves
in that way. And that one of our own
lawyers could lend himself to such a transaction!
Now all the profit will go to strangers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>People believe it, at any rate; and to-morrow
or next day you may look for some editorial comments
on the fact. Every one is indignant about
it already. I heard several people say that if this
rumour is confirmed they will strike their names
off the lists.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the rumour? How did that shameful

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Lona, I find I can talk to you as I can to no one

my share in spreading the rumour.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You! And you could do this wrong to the

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You must not condemn me without remembering
how matters stood at the time. As I told
you yesterday, I came home to find my mother
involved in a whole series of foolish undertakings.
Disasters of various kinds followed; all possible
ill-luck seemed to crowd in upon us; our house
was on the verge of ruin. I was half reckless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and half in despair. Lona, I believe it was
principally to deaden thought that I got into
that entanglement which ended in Johan’s
going away.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You can easily imagine that there were all sorts
of rumours in the air after you two had left. It
was said that this was not his first misdemeanour.
Some said Dorf had received a large sum of money
from him to hold his tongue and keep out of the
way; others declared she had got the money.
At the same time it got abroad that our house
had difficulty in meeting its engagements. What
more natural than that the scandal-mongers should
put these two rumours together? Then, as Madam
Dorf remained here in unmistakable poverty,
people began to say that he had taken the money
with him to America; and rumour made the sum
larger and larger every day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you, Karsten——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I clutched at the rumour as a drowning man
clutches at a straw.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You helped to spread it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I did not contradict it. Our creditors were
beginning to press upon us; I had to quiet them—to
prevent them from doubting the solidity of
the firm. I let it be thought that a momentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>misfortune had befallen us, but that if people
only refrained from pressing us—if they would
only give us time—every one should be paid in
full.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And every one <em class='gesperrt'>was</em> paid in full?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Lona; that rumour saved our house and
made me the man I am.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Whom did it hurt, then? Johan intended
never to return.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You ask whom it hurt? Look into yourself

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Look into any man you please, and you will
find at least <em class='gesperrt'>one</em> dark spot that must be kept out
of sight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you call yourselves pillars of society!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then what does it matter whether such a
society is supported or not? What is it that
passes current here? Lies and shams—nothing
else. Here are you, the first man in the town,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>prosperous, powerful, looked up to by every one—you,
who have set the brand of crime upon an
innocent man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do you think I do not feel deeply the wrong I

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Johan, let me in two words explain the circumstances——</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There is no necessity; I understand the circumstances
very well. Your house was in a difficult

unprotected name and fame to do what you liked
with——Well, I don’t blame you so much for it;
we were young and thoughtless in those days. But
now I need the truth, and now you must speak out.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>And just at this moment I require all my moral

  </div>

<p class='c001'>I don’t care so much about the falsehoods you

</div>

<p class='c001'>Have you considered that, if I plead guilty to
the one thing, I plead guilty to the other as well?
I can prove by our books, you say, that there was
no embezzlement at all? But I cannot; our books
were not so accurately kept in those days. And
even if I could, what would be gained by it?
Should I not figure, at best, as the man who,
having once saved himself by falsehood, had let
that falsehood, and all its consequences, run on for
fifteen years, without taking a single step to retract
it? You have forgotten what our society is, or you
would know that that would crush me to the very
dust.</p>

<p class='c001'>I can only repeat that I shall make Madam

<p class='c001'>[<i>Wipes the perspiration from his forehead.</i>] Hear
me, Johan—and you, too, Lona. My position at
this moment is not an ordinary one. I am so
situated, that if you strike this blow you destroy
me utterly, and not only me, but also a great and
golden future for the community which was, after
all, the home of your childhood.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And if I do not strike the blow, I destroy all
that makes my own future of value to me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Go on, Karsten.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then listen. Everything turns upon this question
of the railway, and that is not so simple as you
think. Of course you have heard that last year
there was some talk of a coast-line? It had many
powerful advocates in the district, and especially in
the press; but I succeeded in blocking it, because
it would have injured our steamboat trade along
the coast.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Have you an interest in this steamboat trade?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but no one dared to impugn my motives
on that account. My spotless name was an ample
safeguard. For that matter, I could have borne
the loss; but the town could not. Then the inland
line was determined on. As soon as the route was
fixed, I assured myself secretly that a branch connection
between it and the town was practicable.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why secretly, Karsten?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Have you heard any talk of the great buying-up
of forests, mines, and water-power?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Johan.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, for a company in some other town——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>As these properties now lie, they are as good as
worthless to their scattered owners; so they have
sold comparatively cheap. If the purchaser had
waited until the branch line was known to be in
contemplation, the vendors would have demanded
fancy prices.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Very likely; but what then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now comes the point which may or may not be
interpreted favourably—a risk which no man in
our community could afford to incur, unless he had
a spotless and honoured name to rely upon.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is I who have bought up the whole.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is the great point. With the unblemished
reputation I have hitherto borne, I can
take the whole affair upon my shoulders and carry
it through, saying to my fellow citizens, “See,
this I have ventured for the good of the community!”</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>To make sure of their support, I had to let

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lona.</span></div>
  </div>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Can you not see that it is society itself that
compels us to adopt these indirect courses?
What would have happened if I had not acted
secretly? Why, every one would have thrown
himself into the undertaking, and the whole thing
would have been broken up, frittered away,
bungled, and ruined. There is not a single man
here, except myself, that knows how to organise
an enormous concern such as this will become; in
this country the men of real business ability are
almost all of foreign descent. That is why my
conscience acquits me in this matter. Only in
my hands can all this property be of permanent
benefit to the many whose subsistence will
depend upon it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The welfare of your native place is no less at
stake. If things come to the surface which cast
a slur upon my past life, all my opponents will
join forces and overwhelm me. In our society a
boyish error is never effaced. People will scrutinise
my whole career, will rake up a thousand
trifling incidents and interpret and comment
upon them in the light of these disclosures.
They will crush me beneath the weight of
rumours and slanders. I shall have to retire
from the railway board; and if I take my hand
away, the whole thing will fall to pieces, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>shall have to face not only ruin but social
extinction.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A thought has occurred to me lately: When
one stands on the threshold of a great undertaking,
that is to promote the welfare of thousands,—if
a single sacrifice should be demanded——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Take, for example, a man who is starting a
large manufactory. He knows very well—for all
experience has taught him—that sooner or later,
in the working of that manufactory, human life
will be lost.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Rörlund.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Or suppose he is about to open a mine. He
takes into his service both fathers of families and
young men in the heyday of life. May it not be
predicted with certainty that some will perish in
the undertaking?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Bernick.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well; such a man, then, knows beforehand
that his enterprise will undoubtedly, some time
or other, lead to the loss of life. But the undertaking
is for the greater good of the greater
number; for every life it costs, it will, with equal
certainty, promote the welfare of many hundreds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but let us take a peculiar case. Let us
suppose a blasting has to be made at a dangerous
place; and unless it is carried out, the railway
will come to a standstill. Suppose the engineer
knows that it will cost the life of the workman
who fires the fuse; but fired it must be, and it is
the engineer’s duty to send a workman to do it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I know what you will say: It would be heroic

So he must sacrifice a workman.</p>

of staking capital. But we, I hope, look at things
from an entirely different moral standpoint. Think
of our exemplary shipowners! Name me a single

announce what you have ventured to do for the

<p class='c001'>Impossible, much as I should like to. The
Doctor’s speech will, of course, be mainly addressed
to you. Perhaps a few words will be devoted to
the rest of us. I have spoken to Vigeland and
Sandstad about it. We had arranged that your
reply should take the form of a toast to the
general welfare of the community. Sandstad
will say a few words on the harmony between
the different classes of the community; Vigeland
will express the fervent hope that our new undertaking
may not disturb the moral basis upon
which we stand; and I will call attention, in a
few well-chosen words, to the claims of Woman,
whose more modest exertions are not without
their use in the community. But you are not
listening——</p>

depicted in your countenance, that it is as unexpected
guests that we intrude upon you in your
happy family circle, at your peaceful hearth,
surrounded by upright and public-spirited friends
and fellow citizens. Our excuse is that we obey
a heartfelt impulse in bringing you our homage.
It is not, indeed, the first time we have done so,
but the first time on so comprehensive a scale.
We have often expressed to you our gratitude for
the broad moral basis upon which you have, so to
speak, built up our society. This time we chiefly
hail in you the clear-sighted, indefatigable, unselfish,
nay, self-sacrificing citizen, who has taken
the initiative in an undertaking which, we are
credibly assured, will give a powerful impetus to
the temporal prosperity and wellbeing of this
community.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consul Bernick, you have for many years stood
before our town as a shining example. I do not
here speak of your exemplary domestic life, your
spotless moral record. To such virtues we pay
tribute in the secret chamber of the heart; we do
not proclaim them from the house-tops. I speak
rather of your activity as a citizen, as it lies open
to all men’s view. Well-appointed ships sail from
your wharves, and fly our flag on the furthest seas.
A large and prosperous body of workmen looks up
to you as to a father. By calling into existence new
branches of industry, you have brought comfort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>into hundreds of homes. In other words—you
are in an eminent sense the pillar and cornerstone
of this community.</p>

model of all the civic virtues. May your enterprise
contribute to the true and lasting welfare of
this community! The railway is, no doubt, an
institution by means of which elements of evil
may be imported from without, but it is also an
institution that enables us to get quickly rid of
them. From elements of evil from without we
cannot even now keep ourselves quite free. But

not been undertaken in the hope of any tangible

You have many a time, amid the ring of wine-cups,
done battle in eloquent words for the civic
interests of our community; may you often find
worthy opportunities to lift and drain this goblet.—To
you, Mr. Sandstad, I hand this album, with
photographs of your fellow citizens. Your well-known

offer, for the decoration of your domestic sanctum,
this book of family devotion, on vellum, and
luxuriously bound. Under the ripening influence
of years, you have come to view life from a serious
standpoint; your activity in the daily affairs of
this world has long been purified and ennobled by
thoughts of things higher and holier. [<i>Turns

I do not deserve it; for until to-day I have not

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted below. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Introduction to <cite>The League of Youth</cite>, mention is
made of a ‘usually long’ pause before publication of the work, but
based on the following discussion, the word was certainly meant to
be ‘unusually’.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

edition.
